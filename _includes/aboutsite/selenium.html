    <summary>Python Selenium Module</summary>
    <p>Selenium is an open-source framework that allows developers 
        to automate web browsers for tasks like web testing and web scraping. It provides a 
        programming interface for controlling browsers, simulating user interactions, 
        and extracting data from websites.

        Selenium is the key to putting this all together. The background task will start
        the Jekyll server and then uses Selenium to download the generated HTML for my 
        Resume, export it to a PDF, then checks the "Show Cover Letter" box on my site and 
        then exports my CV to another PDF.
