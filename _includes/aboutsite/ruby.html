    <p>Jekyll supports Ruby scripts in the build process. I have obfuscated my
        contact information in the Liquid templates files committed to my repository
        so web crawlers won't pick it up. This information is excluded from the
        generated HTML when viewing the site online. But when I run this site on
        my Jekyll installation on my local machine Jekyll runs my Ruby scripts
        to deobfuscate my contact information during the build process and
        embeds the information in the generated HTML files.
        From there, I can export my site to create my CV and Resume PDFs
        and it will include my contact information. This is what I provide to potential employers.
