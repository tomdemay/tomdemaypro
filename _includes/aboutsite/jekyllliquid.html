    <p>Jekyll generates static HTML files during the build process.
        Jekyll uses the "Liquid" templating language to create reusable
        templates for this sites layout and structure. With Liquid, you
        can include variables, conditionals, loops, and other logic to
        dynamically generate content. </p>
    <p>GitHub only serves static web pages. Initially I had to copy elements
        that are common to every page to each HTML document. It
        quickly became a pain to keep them in sync and I was constantly
        breaking something.
    </p>
    <p>The solution to this problem was solved by moving everything to
        Jekyll. This allowed me to break every element down to separate
        files that get pulled together during the build process to build
        and deploy static web pages to my website. The main pages of this
        site basically include the name of the Liquid template, the title
        of the page and the content for the page. I do not need to include
        anything else. Jekyll will combine everything using my default Liquid
        "layout" template.</p>
    <p>
        Previously a page like this would have been over 1000 lines of HTML and probably
        80% would be duplicated on every page. The code below is what makes up
        the HTML file you are viewing right now. The content for each section
        is in each of the listed HTML files. You can see how the Liquid templates are broken up for this site at my
