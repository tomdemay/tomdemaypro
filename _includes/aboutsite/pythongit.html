    <summary>Python Git Module</summary>
    <p>Python Git Module is used in my background task to download any changes from
        my remote GitHub repository to my local repository whenever a change is made.
        This permits me to modify the content of my site from anywhere, including on my mobile phone and have it pushed
        to my local machine where PDFs with my contact information are created programmatically.
