    <p>GitHub Actions is a workflow automation platform 
        that allows you to automate tasks in your GitHub repository, 
        triggered by events like code changes or support tickets. It uses YAML files 
        to define workflows with jobs and steps, and integrates with other GitHub 
        features and external services.</p>

            </a> GitActions pipeline is triggered to run and uses Jekyll to 
            combined my Liquid templates, and run any Ruby code I might have, 
            to build my static web pages and deploy them to this site.
