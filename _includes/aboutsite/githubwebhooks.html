    <summary>GitHub WebHooks</summary>
    <p>
        When I commit a change to my GitHub repository, GitHub will invoke
        a "webhook" running on my local computer. This WebHook is essentially a 
        REST API. When the WebHook is called, it triggers downloading the code
        from the remote GitHub repository, starting a Jekyll server locally to regenerate my pages with
        the contact information and exports my CV and Resume to PDF files
        and uploads them to various cloud providers so they are available to me
        on my mobile devices.
        If I wanted to, I can make a change to my Professional Skills or fix a typo
        in my Resume from my mobile device. When I commit the change my new PDFs 
        with the changes are available on my phone within 50 seconds of making a change.
        I can send it to future employers from there, or upload them to a 
        job application site.
