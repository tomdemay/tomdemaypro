        Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment
        and management of applications in lightweight, isolated containers. Containers
        provide a consistent and reproducible environment for running software,
        allowing applications to be easily packaged with their dependencies, and
        ensuring consistency across different systems.

    <p>RabbitMQ has a reputation as being hard to install and configure. So I choose not to.
        A RabbitMQ docker image is available in the Docker hub repository. Simply executing
        the following command pulls a fully functional pre-configured RabbitMQ server
        and starts it on my local machine. </p>
    <div class="code-snippet">
        <pre><code>docker run -d --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq</code></pre>
    </div>

        I was able to integrate the Python Docker module into my Python Flask website to
        download the RabbitMQ docker container from the Docker repository and start it when the Flask website starts
        and stops the RabbitMQ docker container when the Flask website stops.
