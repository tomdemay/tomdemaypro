    <p>Celery supports various
        message brokers, such as RabbitMQ or Redis, to handle task message passing
        and result storage. It provides a straightforward way to scale and parallelize
        tasks, making it suitable for handling time-consuming or resource-intensive
        operations in a distributed environment. When a call is made to my WebHook in my
        Python Flask application, Python Celery posts a message in RabbitMQ and
        the Celery Worker process pulls the message from RabbitMQ to perform the task
        to recreate my CV and Resume PDFs.
