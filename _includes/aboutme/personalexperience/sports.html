    <p> When I was eight years old in the mid-seventies, during the Pittsburgh Steelers'
        dominance in the NFL, I played my first season of football. Our team was called
        the Steelers, so naturally, I have been a Pittsburgh Steelers fan ever since.

    <p> Growing up in a wooded neighborhood of Newington Forest in Springfield,
        Virginia, football was an inseparable part of my daily life. Before I moved to
        Virginia, I had never really dabbled in sports. But Virginia changed everything!
        Football, in particular, stole my heart, and I quickly fell head over heels for
        the game. Rain or shine, you'd find me out on the street playing a game of
        pickup ball. It became a daily ritual, an unstoppable passion that ignited with
        every touchdown and tackle. </p>
    <p> Coaching my children's sports teams brings me immense joy and fulfillment. For
        me, it's not just about the wins and losses; it's about creating an environment
        where kids can have fun and develop their skills. I prioritize the growth and
        enjoyment of every child on the team, rather than solely focusing on winning
        games. I always emphasize to my kids that winning is not the sole measure of
        success. In fact, I encourage them to embrace losses as valuable learning
        opportunities. It's through these moments of defeat that we can learn from those
        who are more skilled and improve ourselves. Being part of an organized team
        offers a myriad of chances for children to acquire vital life skills. Witnessing
        the growth, learning, and personal development of these young individuals is
        incredibly rewarding, and it's a privilege to be part of their journey. </p>
