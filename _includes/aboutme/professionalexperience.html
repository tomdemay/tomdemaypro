    <p> With nearly 30 years of experience as a Software Engineer, I have accumulated a diverse
        range of expertise. Throughout my career, I have served in various roles, including
        individual contributor, technical lead, and management positions. While I possess a deep
        understanding of coding, I also thrive as a problem solver. No matter the challenge at
        hand, I take full ownership, from inception to completion, leveraging my ability to
        build the necessary tools, systems, and teams required to achieve the desired goals.
    </p>
    <p> I am particularly passionate about the software development process and continuously
        seek ways to enhance efficiency, write maintainable code, improve team and
        organizational communication, deliver consistent and reliable estimates, and mentor
        junior developers. As I acquire domain knowledge, I naturally transition into a
        technical leadership role. My previous employers and colleagues hold me in high regard,
        appreciating my commitment to refactoring and my collaborative approach when working
        alongside other engineers and managers. </p>
    <p> My insatiable appetite for learning has always driven me to acquire new skills. For
        instance, shortly after completing high school in 1989, in just under 3 months I
        obtained a series 6 and 63 license to sell securities. In 2000, I earned a private
        pilot's license in a span of three months. In addition to my accomplishments outside of
        software engineering, I am entirely self-taught in the field of software engineering. By
        my late 20s, I had already assumed engineering management roles, published works on
        software engineering principles, and delivered speeches at local user group meetings. At
        the age of 30, I pursued a computer science degree, completing four years of coursework
        in just one year while maintaining a GPA of 4.0. In 2003, I embarked on building <a

            <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt fa-xs"></i></a> as an experimental project to
        learn how to build web sites, which eventually became one of the leading sites in its
        industry, consistently generating annual revenue in the range of half a million dollars
        until I successfully sold it for a profit in 2011. The site, still operational, proudly
        asserts its status as the largest supplier of gaming equipment, outlasting many of its
        competitors. </p>
    <p> My reputation is built on maintaining high standards, crafting well-designed and
        maintainable code, and effectively collaborating with others. I have rescued several
        failing projects, receiving numerous accolades for my efforts, and hold a patent.
        Mentoring and developing the skills of junior and struggling engineers are among my
        passions. Refactoring code is a task I relish, having achieved remarkable performance
        improvements, such as a 3,951% boost in one instance. Previously, code that originally
        took 6 hours to run before crashing due to resource consumption was refactored to
        complete in just 6 minutes, utilizing only 40MB of memory. </p>
    <p> As evident from my journey, I possess an unwavering commitment to continuous education.
        I have taught myself a multitude of technologies, including C/C++, .NET, C#, Windows and
        Linux platforms, Java, Python, PowerShell, bash, Ruby, Regular Expressions, classic ASP,
        HTML/CSS, SQL and No-SQL databases, and cloud computing, to name a few. Currently, I am
        actively honing my skills in front-end web development using Java Spring, Spring Boot,
        Angular, React.js, MVC, and LAMP stacks. I am also working towards attaining my AWS and
        Azure certifications, with future plans to delve into machine learning and AI. </p>
