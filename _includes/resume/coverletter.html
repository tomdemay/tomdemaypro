        <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
        <p>I would like to introduce myself. My name is Tom DeMay. I am a Lead Senior Software Engineer and Manager with
            Altamira Technologies Corporation working primarily in the national security space. I would like to tell
            you a little bit about me and why I feel I would be a great addition to your company. </p>
        <p>I have been a Software Engineer for over 30 years with a tremendously wide range of experiences;
            as an individual contributor, technical lead, and management. Ultimately I am a hands on engineer.
            I am much more than just a coder. I am a problem solver. Bring whatever problem you have to me and
            I will own it from inception to completion. I will build the necessary tools, systems and teams and
            lead them to accomplish any goal.</p>
        <p>I have a passion for the software factory process. I always look for ways to be more efficient, write
            maintainable code, improve team and organization communication, deliver consistent and reliable
            estimates and mentor junior developers. I maintain a great relationship with all my previous employers
            and team mates. I refactor relentlessly. I enjoy collaborating with other engineers and managers I
            can learn from. </p>
        <p>I aggressively acquire new skills and am constantly learning. Fresh out of high school in 1989, I studied and
            passed the Series 6 and 63 licenses to sell securities within two months. In 2000, I earned my private
            pilot's license in three months after my first flight lesson, completing the ground school on my own. Since
            2009, I have been performing live, playing the piano, keyboards, guitar, harmonica, and banjoâ€”all
            self-taught.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a self-taught software engineer, by my late 20s I managed other software engineers, published with
            Advisor Publications, and spoke on software engineering principles at local user group meetings. At 30, I
            completed four years of school in one year to earn my Bachelor's in Computer Science, maintaining a 4.0 GPA.
            In 2003, I built <a href="https://www.discountcasinogear.com/">www.discountcasinogear.com</a> as an
            experiment to learn web application development. It became one of the leading sites in its industry,
            generating half a million in annual revenue until I sold it for a profit in 2011. The site continues to
            operate and claims to be the largest supplier of gaming equipment, as many of its competitors have come and
            gone.
        </p>
        <p>I have a reputation for having high standards, writing well designed code that is maintainable and I
            work well with others. I received numerous awards for bailing out a number of failing projects and hold a
            patent. I mentor and develop the skills of junior and struggling engineers. I enjoy
            refactoring code. In one case I improved performance by 3,951%. In that particular case, code that
            initially took 6 hours to run before it failed, consuming all the computer's resources and crashing,
            was refactored to complete in 6 minutes using only 40MB of memory. </p>
        <p>As you can see, I am an aggressive learner and have a passion for continued education. Rust, GoLang, C/C++,
            C# .NET, Java, Python, Website development, SQL and NoSQL, various back end databases, and
            cloud computing are just a few of the tech stacks I have taught myself. I am currently working on
            web applications with Java, Spring Boot, and React.js and currently working towards my
            AWS and Azure certifications</p>
        <p>As you can tell I am very proud of my history and accomplishments. I am excited to share with you my
            many success stories and even some not so successful stories that became learning opportunities for
            me. I honestly believe I can fit in well in any organization in a variety of different roles due to
            my passion for software engineering and learning. I am open to any kind of development. Above
            all, I like being creative, collaborating with others and learning, which I believe would to be a
            tremendous asset to your organization.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your time and your consideration. Sincerely,</p>
        <br />
        Tom DeMay
