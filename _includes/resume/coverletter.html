        <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

        <p>My name is Tom DeMay. I am a Principal Software Engineer and Manager with Altamira Technologies Corporation,
            working in the national security space in support of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Intelligence
            Community (IC). I hold a Top Secret security clearance with SCI. I would like to tell you a little bit about
            myself and why I feel I would be a great addition to your company.</p>

        <p>I have over 30 years of experience as a self-taught Software Engineer. I have served as an individual
            contributor, technical lead, and manager. Above all, I’m a hands-on engineer and problem solver. Bring me
            any problem, and I will own it from inception to completion, building the tools, systems, and teams needed
            to accomplish the goal.</p>

        <p>I have a passion for the software factory process: increasing efficiency, writing maintainable code,
            improving communication, delivering reliable estimates, and mentoring developers. I refactor
            relentlessly and enjoy cleaning up technical debt.</p>

        <p>I hold multiple professional certifications and have experience architecting, building, and deploying
            cloud-native applications. I leverage modern technologies to ensure scalability and reliability, and these
            skills complement my hands-on experience and demonstrate my ability to adapt to evolving industry standards.
        </p>

        <p>I aggressively acquire new skills and am constantly learning. Fresh out of high school in 1989, I studied and
            passed the Series 6 and 63 licenses to sell securities to investors within two months. In 2000, I earned my
            private pilot's license in three months after my first flight lesson, completing the ground school on my
            own. Since 2009, I have been performing live, playing the piano, keyboards, guitar, harmonica, and banjo—all
            self-taught.</p>

        <p>As a self-taught software engineer, by my late 20s I managed other software engineers, published with
            Advisor Publications, and spoke on software engineering principles at local user group meetings. At 30, I
            completed four years of school in one year to earn my Bachelor's in Computer Science, maintaining a 4.0 GPA.
            In 2003, I built <a href="https://www.discountcasinogear.com/">www.discountcasinogear.com</a> as an
            experiment to learn web application development. It became one of the leading sites in its industry,
            generating half a million in annual revenue until I sold it for a profit in 2011. The site continues to
            operate and claims to be the largest supplier of gaming equipment, as many of its competitors have come and
            gone.</p>

        <p>I have a reputation for high standards, writing well-designed maintainable code, and work well with
            others. I received numerous awards for bailing out a number of failing projects, leading performance
            improvements ranging from roughly 3,900% to over 8,500%. In one case, a backend data collection service that
            ran for 6 hours before exhausting all system resources was refactored to complete in 6 minutes using only
            40MB of memory. In another, I tuned databases to perform 99.5% of all queries in 1 millisecond that
            previously took up to 10 seconds. In a third case, I took over leadership of a 3D interactive web
            application project using Cesium, JavaScript, and TypeScript. We had a year to deliver performance
            improvements, but we completed them nine months early—just three months after I joined the team.</p>

        <p>I am proud of my history and accomplishments. I believe I can fit into any organization in many roles due to
            my passion for software engineering and learning. I value creativity, collaboration, and continuous
            growth—qualities I believe would benefit your organization greatly.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
        <br />
        Tom DeMay
