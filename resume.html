            <p>I hold a senior position on the <strong>EC2</strong> Zonal Interface Management
                (ZIM) team. ZIM plays a critical role in managing all network interfaces and IP addresses
                for <strong>EC2</strong>. It operates at a low level and
                relies on <strong>AWS</strong> technologies such as <strong>DynamoDB</strong>
                and <strong>S3</strong>. Our development environment primarily consists of
                <strong>Linux</strong>, and we utilize <strong>Java</strong>,
                <strong>Ruby</strong>, and <strong>Scala</strong> for coding purposes.</p>
            <ul class="projects-list">
                <li>Implemented a code <strong>refactoring</strong> initiative to enhance
                    service decoupling, resulting in improved modularity and maintainability.
                    The refactoring process involved utilizing <strong>Java</strong> for
                    development, creating automated <strong>API tests</strong> in
                    <strong>Ruby</strong>, and performing blackbox automated testing using
                    <strong>Scala</strong>. This approach ensured robustness and streamlined the
                    testing process. 
                </li>
                <li>Drove substantial <strong>performance enhancements</strong> and extended the
                    <strong>scalability</strong> of service hosts across multiple
                    <strong>EC2</strong> regions by consolidating services and reducing round
                    trips. These optimizations resulted in significant performance improvements
                    that caught the attention of top engineers and managers within
                    <strong>AWS/EC2</strong>. The demonstrated impact of these enhancements
                    showcased the ability to unlock greater efficiency and scalability within
                    the infrastructure. 
                </li>
                <li>Collaborated with cross-functional teams to implement an
                    approach for enabling user tagging of <strong>EC2</strong> resources during
                    creation, spanning across the entire <strong>EC2</strong> infrastructure. In
                    one of my initial assignments at Amazon, I took on the responsibility of
                    creating test plans for this project, leveraging the
                    <strong>AWS CLI</strong>. Additionally, I provided assistance to cleared
                    engineers in executing these test plans within secured regions. 
                </li>
                <li>Modified an existing public API to incorporate <strong>idempotent</strong>
                    support, ensuring reliable and predictable behavior. This undertaking
                    involved close collaboration with multiple teams involved in releasing new
                    features to the public. I worked closely with documentation, security
                    review, test planning, and penetration testing teams to ensure seamless
                    integration. The project involved making architectural changes to both new
                    and legacy systems, utilizing development languages such as
                    <strong>Scala</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong>, and <strong>Java</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>Effectively transitioned into the <strong>On-Call rotation</strong>, 
                    taking on the responsibility of providing critical support and
                    resolving urgent issues. This role required me to be available around the
                    clock, demonstrating my commitment to maintaining the stability and
                    availability of the systems. By promptly addressing and resolving complex
                    incidents, I played a pivotal role in ensuring uninterrupted service for our
                    customers and earned the trust and recognition of my peers and

            <p>In November 2019, GigaTrust unfortunately went bankrupt, leading to the closure
                of its operations. After nearly 11 years with GigaTrust and 12 years with EMC, I
                found myself out of work for the first time in almost 23 years.
                During this time, I focused on upgrading my skills and exploring new

                <strong>managed</strong> a team of up to 6 individuals, providing support for a
                file system <strong>device driver</strong>. I played a key role in
                refactoring a monolithic <strong>VB6</strong> client application into a
                collection of reusable <strong>APIs</strong>, <strong>Windows Services</strong>,
                and new client and server applications developed in <strong>C/C++</strong> and <strong>C# .NET</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>GigaTrust's primary objectives was to enhance our customer's <strong>data
                    security</strong> by safeguarding them against inadvertent leakage of
                sensitive information. Through the implementation of these 
                applications and services, we were able to provide protection and mitigate
                potential risks for our clients.</p>

                    <strong>bash</strong>, and <strong>PowerShell scripts</strong>. CruiseControl was later ported to 
                    <strong>Jenkins</strong> and <strong>SVN</strong> was replaced with <strong>Git</strong>.
                    <ul>
                        <li>These code improvements dramatically improved maintainability and support
                            enabling developers to dedicate their efforts to other projects, such
                            as the development of new Android and Apple iOS apps.</li>
                        <li>Enhanced the maturity of the product and introduced software

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Implemented a process for delivering code to the quality assurance group,

                            system from scratch within in just 2 months,
                            surpassing the previous team's two-year struggle to meet the project
                            requirements.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Led the migration effort to transition the version control 
                    system from <strong>Redmine</strong> to the industry-standard
                    <strong>Jira</strong>, ensuring a seamless and efficient process.</li>

                self-guided journey to master <strong>C/C++</strong>. Through 
                determination and countless hours of learning, I acquired proficiency in
                this programming language. This newfound expertise proved instrumental
                in propelling me towards the product division of Softworks.</p>
            <ul class="projects-list">
                <li>Utilized the power of <strong>Web Based Enterprise Management
                        (WBEM)</strong>, <strong>Common Information Model (CIM)</strong>, and
                    <strong>Storage Management Initiative (SMI)</strong> technologies to
                    engineer <strong>C++</strong> applications deployed across
                    various <strong>Windows</strong> and <strong>UNIX</strong> platforms. These
                    innovative solutions enabled seamless management, proactive alerts, and
                    streamlined discovery of Storage Area Networks, empowering
                    enterprises to optimize their storage infrastructure effectively.</li>
                <li>Assisted a team grappling with challenging requirements. 
                    Through proactive code refactoring, I
                    revolutionized their approach to managing and reporting on storage system
                    arrays. Furthermore, I established a process for integration
                    testing with the enterprise system on a predictable basis. The impact was
                    transformative: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improved performance by a staggering 3,951% and slashed memory
                            consumption by an impressive 2,027%.</li>
                        <li>Efficiency gains achieved through code and process enhancements led
                            to a remarkable team reduction from 6 to 2 skilled engineers,
                            enhancing resource allocation and driving cost savings.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Personally conducted training sessions for all EMC
                    engineers in Alexandria, Virginia, on the proper
                    techniques to maintain large data structures utilizing 
                    <strong>Standard Template Library (STL)</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>Developed a Windows <strong>device
                        driver</strong> capable of efficiently managing storage and providing
                    comprehensive reports on system resources. This <strong>device
                        driver</strong> empowered users to harness the full potential of their
                    systems, elevating their productivity and enabling seamless operations.</li>
                <li>Steered a highly skilled team of 7 brilliant minds proficient in
                    <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>C/C++</strong>, <strong>MVS</strong>, and
                    <strong>Java</strong> to architect an application framework that
                    became the backbone of EMC's Control Center client applications. This
                    revolutionary framework spanned across diverse platforms, including
                    <strong>Windows</strong>, <strong>AIX</strong>, <strong>HP/UX</strong>,
                    <strong>Solaris</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong>, and <strong>MVS</strong>
                </li>
                <li>Orchestrated the integration of two prominent companies and their
                    respective products, leveraging the power of
                    <strong>Java</strong>. For my contributions, I was honored with
                    EMC's prestigious <strong>Most Valuable Player</strong> award among a team
                    of 200 talented engineers in August 2006, recognizing the impact
                    of the project on EMC's success.</li>
                <li>Pioneered the development of a <strong>C#</strong> plugin that marshaled
                    data between EMC libraries written in <strong>C/C++</strong> and Microsoft's
                    <strong>Systems Center Operations Manager (SCOM)</strong> application. This
                    integration streamlined operations and fortified the interoperability of EMC
                    and Microsoft technologies, amplifying their joint capabilities.</li>
